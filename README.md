## About This Project

This repository contains my analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset (file: [penguins.ipynb](penguins.ipynb)), which comprises observations of penguin species in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The dataset is widely used in the field of data science, making it an excellent resource for teaching and learning.
The Palmer Penguins dataset includes various measurements of penguins, such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. Additionally, it provides information about the penguin species, including Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, as well as their respective habitats on the islands of Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen.
